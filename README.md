The Problem
===========

You are in a room with a circle of N chairs. The chairs are numbered
sequentially from 1 to N.

At some point in time, the person in chair #1 will be asked to leave. The
person in chair #2 will be skipped, and the person in chair #3 will be asked
to leave. This pattern of skipping one person and asking the next to leave
will keep going around the circle until there is one person left the survivor.

The Assignment
==============

Write an iOS Objective-C app to determine which chair the survivor is sitting
in, given N as input provided by the user. The user should be able to:

  1. Specify N

  2. Calculate the survivor number.

  3. Specify a new N, and obtain a new survivor number, and so on.

Please observe the following when designing and implementing the app:

  1. The interface should be simple, clean, and obvious.

  2. The implementation should adhere to and exhibit your understanding of
     standard iOS design patterns.

  3. Use of ARC is discouraged, and your solution should have no memory leaks.

  4. You're free to be as creative as you like, within the guidelines
     listed above.
